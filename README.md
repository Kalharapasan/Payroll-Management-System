# Payroll Management System

A simple, PHP-based Payroll Management System built to manage employee records, calculate salaries, and generate basic payroll reports. This repository contains the web application files meant to run on a local PHP/MySQL stack (for example, XAMPP).

## Features
- Employee CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Salary calculation and allowances/deductions support
- Basic payroll reports and payslip generation
- Simple role-based access (admin/user) — if implemented in code

## Requirements
- PHP 7.4+ (or compatible version supported by your XAMPP)
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Apache (bundled with XAMPP)
- Web browser

## Quick setup (local - XAMPP)
1. Install XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/).
2. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
3. Copy the project folder into your web root. For XAMPP on Windows this is usually `C:\xampp\htdocs\PMS_I` (this repo).
4. Create a new MySQL database (for example `pms_db`).
5. Import the project's SQL schema if available (look for a `.sql` file in the repo). If there's no schema file, create tables according to the application requirements (employees, payrolls, users, etc.).
6. Update database connection settings in the project (commonly a `config.php` or similar file) with your DB name, username, and password.
7. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost/PMS_I` (or the folder name you used).

## Typical file structure
- `index.php` - Application entry or landing page
- `README.md` - This file
- `Img/` - Images used by the application (logos, icons)
- `config.php` (or similar) - Database and app configuration (may be named differently)
- `assets/`, `css/`, `js/` - Static assets (if present)

Adjust names above to match the actual files in this repo.

## Usage
- Log in with an admin account (if authentication is implemented).
- Add employees and their salary details.
- Use payroll section to compute salaries for a pay period and generate payslips.

## Development notes & next steps
- Add an SQL schema file (`schema.sql`) to make initial setup easier.
- Add environment configuration (for example `config.sample.php`) and documentation for DB credentials.
- Add simple unit or integration tests where possible.
- Consider migrating to prepared statements or an ORM to prevent SQL injection.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a `config.sample.php` and `schema.sql` to the repo to make setup one-command easier.
- Create a short script that bootstraps the database schema.

Tell me which of those you'd like and I can create the files and update the README accordingly.
